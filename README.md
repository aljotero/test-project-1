# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Alvaro Jose Tello (AJ Tello)

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

JavaScript Style https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The only knowledge I had about programming was what I learned in the introductory C++ class. I had never had an approach to anything related to web development, so I was unfamiliar with HTML and CSS. At the same time, JavaScript was somewhat more familiar to me. The difficulty was not understanding each of these files' functions but creating a project connecting the different languages. When programming with a single language, keeping track of the program's structure can be somewhat more manageable since it is a little more "linear." However, when working with multiple code files, the first time can be a little frustrating. 
Another aspect that is not clear to me is working with sounds and generating tones for the buttons. Fortunately, for this work, no such knowledge was necessary.
Finally, because I was working with three code files for the first time, writing the logic for the "guess" function was the most complicated aspect, in my opinion. I repeatedly tried to do it on my own, but it gets a bit confusing to get the program to run according to the flowchart. In the end, I had to rely on the guide code to finish the program. The good thing is that this exercise showed me that it is a matter of practice to acquire the necessary web development skills.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After doing this work, my doubts are a little more general than specific. First, I am intrigued by working on the design theme and creating a more visually appealing site. How do you get from developing a Simon says game with a few pairs of buttons to pages where you can provide services to customers? Should a software engineer, or in this case, a web developer, be able to cover all the fields from graphic design, sound (in this case), code structure, etc.? What is the website development process like? Who is involved in the development of a website? How long does it take on average (I know that each case is different) to develop a website? How long does it take on average to create a game like the one we have just developed?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[First, I would spend more time on interface design. Thinking that it is a children's game, I would look for a theme that does not involve colors. This would immediately rule out gameplay for users with disabilities such as color blindness. 
The incursion of sounds to each button gives the possibility to create patterns with simple melodies that make the experience more enjoyable. Instead of making a random generation of the pattern, randomly choose from already established patterns that contain these melodies (Birthday song, twinkle star, itsy bitsy spider, etc.).]
